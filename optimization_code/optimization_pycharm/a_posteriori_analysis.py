# compare optimal locations to places of high average concentration map
# compare optimal locations to places of high variance according to all possible states (32*144) when stacks emit average emissions
# my solution should probably be identical to the variance...
# However, if i add the cost with different sensor types, then it is different.

# generate all possible states (32*144) when stacks emit average emissions
# compare PEDs of optimal Vs. non-optimal solutions (randomly generated)

# generate weather states according to frequency and stacks emit all kinds of emissions (+-50% from average)
# compare PEDs of optimal Vs. non-optimal solutions (randomly generated)
